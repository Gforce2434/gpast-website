        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Garrett Pasternak, and I am a second year college student at University of California, Riverside. When not on campus, I live in Los Angeles, California with my two parents, brother, and dog. Growing up, education was always emphasized in my family, and I knew from a young age that I wanted to pursue higher education. I worked hard throughout high school, taking advanced classes and participating in various extracurricular activities, such as playing on the highschool basketball team. <br><br>
          
        I have always been passionate about science and technology, and I am currently pursuing a degree in pre business with intentions to pursue a concentration in information systems. I am fascinated by the way that technology can be used to solve complex problems and improve people's lives, and I am eager to make a difference in this field. Growing up in the era of technology, itâ€™s hard to want to shy away from such an impactful part of the future.
        <br><br>
        Outside of the classroom, I am involved in a variety of extracurricular activities. I am a member of Sustainable UCR, where I have the opportunity to learn about innovative ways to reduce trash and waste during daily activities. I am also a member of CSA (Chinese Student Association). Even though I am not Chinese, my friends encouraged me to try it out. I have met some amazing people and have learned a lot about Chinese culture in the process. I also play intramural basketball for the club.
        <br><br>Some of my favorite hobbies include sports, drawing, playing video games, working out, and the most recent, cooking. Iâ€™ve played many sports like basketball, baseball, and soccer ever since I was little, and can often be found rooting for my favorite team, the Miami Dolphins. Whenever Iâ€™m bored or tired Iâ€™ll doodle around, either on a white board or my laptop. Iâ€™ve also made a mural covering a large portion of my backyard wall depicting the canals of Italy. Whenever I need time for relaxation I often turn to video games. As ironic as that sounds, I love playing Apex Legends or Overwatch before bed as I can take any pent up feelings out on the game. 
        <br><br>Working out and cooking are two other things Iâ€™ve come to enjoy a lot. I gain plenty of confidence seeing my progress over the past few months, as well as the progress I hope to make in the future. I only recently started my cooking journey, and I am certainly not a Michelin star level chef. However, the fulfillment of seeing and tasting some amazing meals will never get old.
        <br><br>Looking to the future, I am excited to see where my education and experiences will take me. I intend on becoming a board member of a club as well as joining another business related club. Depending on how I feel, I might look into pursuing a masters degree. Whatever path I choose, I know that I will be well-prepared thanks to my education and experiences.
